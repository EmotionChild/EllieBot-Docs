The permissions system works as a chain. Everytime a command is used, the permissions chain is checked. Starting from the top of it, the command is compared to a rule, if it isn't either allowed or disallowed by that rule it proceeds to check the next rule all the way till it reaches the bottom rule, which allows all commands.</p> <p>To view this permissions chain, do <code>'lp</code>. The rule at the top of the chain takes priority over all rules below it.</p> <p>If you want to remove a permission from the chain of permissions, do <code>'rp X</code> to remove rule number X and similarly, do <code>'mp X Y</code> to move rule number X to number Y (moving, not swapping!).</p> <p>If you want the bot to notify users why they can't use a command or module, use <code>'verbose true</code> and Nadeko will tell you what rule is preventing the command from being used.</p>","title":"Basics &amp; Hierarchy"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#commonly-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Commonly Asked Questions"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#how-do-i-restrict-all-commands-to-a-single-channel","text":"<p>To allow users to only use commands in a specific text channel, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li><code>'asm disable</code><ul> <li>Disables all modules on the entire server</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'acm enable #bot-spammerino</code><ul> <li>Enables all modules in the #bot-spammerino channel</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","title":"How do I restrict all commands to a single channel?"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#how-do-i-allow-only-one-module-to-be-used-in-a-specific-channel","text":"<p>To allow users to only use commands from a certain module, let's say gambling, in a specific text channel, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li><code>'acm disable #gamblers-den</code><ul> <li>Disables all modules in the #gamblers-den channel</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'cm Gambling enable #gamblers-den</code><ul> <li>Enables usage of the Gambling module in the #gamblers-den channel</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","title":"How do I allow only one module to be used in a specific channel?"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#how-do-i-create-a-music-dj","text":"<p>To allow users to only see the current song and have a DJ role for queuing follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li><code>'sm Music disable</code><ul> <li>Disables music commands for everybody</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'sc 'nowplaying enable</code><ul> <li>Enables the \"nowplaying\" command for everyone</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'sc 'listqueue enable</code><ul> <li>Enables the \"listqueue\" command for everyone</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'rm Music enable DJ</code><ul> <li>Enables all music commands only for the DJ role</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","title":"How do I create a music DJ?"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#how-do-i-create-a-nsfw-role","text":"<p>Say you want to only enable NSFW commands for a specific role, just do the following two steps.</p> <ol> <li><code>'sm NSFW disable</code><ul> <li>Disables the NSFW module from being used</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>'rm NSFW enable Lewd</code><ul> <li>Enables usage of the NSFW module for the Lewd role</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","title":"How do I create a NSFW role?"},{"location":"v4/permissions-system/#how-do-i-disable-custom-reactions-from-triggering","text":"<p>If you don't want server or global custom reactions, just block the module that controls their usage:</p> <ol> <li><code>'sm ActualCustomReactions disable</code><ul> <li>Disables the ActualCustomReactions module from being used</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Note: The <code>ActualCustomReactions</code> module controls the usage of custom reactions.
